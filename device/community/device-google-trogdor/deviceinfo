# We are supposed to use "trogdor" board here, but lazor dts does
# not include trogdor compatible which results in loading a wrong
# dtb. "qc7180" board may result in including dtbs that are for
# sc7180 but not related to Chrome OS devices which would increase
# image size. This doesn't happen for us because we provide only 
# dtbs from deviceinfo_dtb variable and nothing more, so use "qc7180"
# board here.
