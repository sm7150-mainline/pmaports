# We are supposed to use "oak" board here, but lazor dts does
# not include oak compatible which results in loading a wrong
# dtb. "mt8173" board may result in including dtbs that are for
# mt8173 but not related to Chrome OS devices which would increase
# image size. This doesn't happen for us because we provide only
# dtbs from deviceinfo_dtb variable and nothing more, so use "mt8173"
# board here.
