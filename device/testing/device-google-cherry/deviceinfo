# We are supposed to use "cherry" board here, but cherry dts does
# not include cherry compatible which results in loading a wrong
# dtb. "mt8195" board may result in including dtbs that are for
# mt8195 but not related to Chrome OS devices which would increase
# image size. This doesn't happen for us because we provide only 
# dtbs from deviceinfo_dtb variable and nothing more, so use "mt8195"
# board here.
