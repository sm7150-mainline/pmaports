# We are supposed to use "corsola" board here, but corsola dts does
# not include corsola compatible which results in loading a wrong
# dtb. "mt8186" board may result in including dtbs that are for
# mt8186 but not related to Chrome OS devices which would increase
# image size. This doesn't happen for us because we provide only 
# dtbs from deviceinfo_dtb variable and nothing more, so use "mt8186"
# board here.
