# This dispatcher script exists to configure a dnsmasq instance managed by
# NetworkManager to restrict DNS responses based on the IP configuration
# supported by NetworkManager's "Primary Connection". The script requires that
# NetworkManager is configured to use/manage dnsmasq.
# For more information about *why* this is necessary, see:
#  - https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/1430
