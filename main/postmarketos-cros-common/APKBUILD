# We can just add "cros-keyboard-map" with -openrc packages to depends, and it would
# be enough for getting it to work, but this way people will not be able to
# uninstall it when they don't want this. Thus, making this as a subpackage of
# "postmarketos-cros-common" and adding it to _pmb_recommends. Naming it
# "postmarketos-cros-keymap" instead of "$pkgname-keymap", so the name is easier to
# remember.

# These devices have custom keyboard layout. They don't have "Meta"
# (Win/Command/Super) key in the place. They also don't have a "Caps
# Lock" key, but there is a "Search" key in the place of "Caps Lock".
# This key is binded as "Meta" in Linux, and it is not that obvious
# for new users (personal experience). Default Gnome hotkeys for
# changing keyboard layout are "Super + Space" and "Shift + Super +
# Space". Therefore on these devices it is "Search + Space" and
# "Shift + Search + Space". When comparing it to a regular keyboard
# it looks like "Caps + Space" and "Shift + Caps + Space" which is
# not obvious at all.
#
# Configure it as "Ctrl + Space" and "Shift + Ctrl + Space" which
# is closer to regular keyboards and matches Chrome OS hotkey.

# The Meta key on these devices is in the place where generally
# "Caps Lock" key is located. This makes it more difficult to press
# hotkeys like "Meta + Shift + Q". There is also the problem of
# unobvious location of "Meta" key.
#
# Thus change the $mod key to Alt by default.
